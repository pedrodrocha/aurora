   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in Appendix A).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that results from an alteration, enhancement, extension,
      modification, or other change to the original work, based on or not
      based on prior work, and whether or not it is patented or otherwise protected.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      contributions that constitute Derivative Works or collective works,
      created by You directly or indirectly from Your contribution to the Work,
      and for which You have sufficient representation and warranties that You
      can grant relevant licenses.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, import, and offer to sell, sell, and have sold the Work,
      wherein such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s)
      alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which
      such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
      against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
      alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
      constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any rights
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the
      date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications,
      and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works
          a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
          that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain in the Source form of any Derivative Works that include
          a human-readable file containing conspicuously and appropriately published
          attributions to the original Work's creation and reuse documentation;
          and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
          then any Derivative Works that include the Work must include a readable
          copy of that NOTICE file, excluding those portions that are
          redefined by additions or changes from You; and

      (e) You may not impose any further restrictions beyond those in this License
          on the exercise of the rights granted herein.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor
      shall be under this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein supersedes or modifies the terms
      of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
      writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
      Contribution) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
      ANY KIND, either express or implied. Including, without limitation, any
      warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY,
      or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
      determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume
      any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate misconduct) or
      agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
      including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
      damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the
      use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
      for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
      or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
      Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, accept responsibility
      for, and fix certain liabilities. However, in accepting such obligations,
      You do so entirely at your own risk and expense and on your sole liability.
